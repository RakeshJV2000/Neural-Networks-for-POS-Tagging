# Neural-Networks-for-POS-Tagging

- Developed and fine-tuned a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model from scratch for part-of-speech tagging on English tweets.
- Experimented with feature engineering - capitalization patterns, common suffixes, and special characters - leading to improved model accuracy from 80.77% to 83.08%.
- Explored multiple neural network architectures, comparing 0, 1, and 2 hidden layers, various layer sizes (128, 256, 512), and activation functions (tanh, ReLU, sigmoid), to optimize model performance for part-of-speech tagging
- Conducted comparative analysis of random versus pre-trained embeddings, demonstrating that fine-tuning pre-trained embeddings achieved a significant accuracy boost, improving from 77.6% to 82.3%.
